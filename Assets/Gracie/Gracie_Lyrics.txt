you're a little bit bored, i'm a little bit tired
maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
are we too far gone i don't know where we started
where took a wrong turn, everything got harder
every time we touch it's like the last time, holding onto something when it's not right
you told me something when i left but i don't remember
maybe 'cause all i could do then was stare at the floor
i held myself 'cause you wouldn't, all wrapped in my sweatshirt, wonder if you even noticed that that one was yours
could you hold me without any talking?
i don't even have to stay
if i woke up with you in the morning, i'd forget all the ways that we're broken
pictures of the old us got me feelin' older
i just thought you should know i never wanted closure
but you had no problem leavin', now i'm the one to feel it
i just can't believe you don't know what i'm feelin', guess you got the best of this
pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em, killin' me a little bit
and i hate the way you love me, and i hate that i still care
how could you think i'd be your friend?
and if i left my t-shirt, you can keep it
i missed your 21st birthday, i've been up at home
almost tried to call you, don't know if i should
hate to picture you half-drunk, happy
hate to think you went out without me
lights on and it's black and white, i couldn't stay forever
when the night is over, don't call me up i'm already under
sometimes i go blurry-eyed, small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
just because you're hurting doesn't mean i'm not
funny when i think about the months that i could not get out of bed
i'm underwater, but i'm over you
i got, you got, we got too much time on our hands
i'm still chasing feelings that i don't understand
we played grown-up, drowned in bathtubs
but you never opened up, and i never said enough
thunder warning, should've called it, but we never gave it up
now i know it wasn't right, wasn't right
and we blamed it on the time, on the time, on the timing, we broke it went silent
slept on floors of angry mornings
but you never let me in, so i stopped wanting it
tearing every wall, and breaking down the doors
kept bending every rule 'till all of me was yours
and pushing things aside, but nothing ever worked
do you remember happy together? i do, don't you?
then all of a sudden, you're sick to your stomach, is that still true?
you said forever in the end i fought it
and I know you said that we're not talking, but i miss you, i'm sorry
i don't wanna go, we've been here before, everywhere i go leads me back to you
packing while you're asleep, you were the catalyst
i don't know what it is about how you breathe, about how you breathe
you're good to everyone, all them but me
and if you hear me leaving in the morning, could you just pretend that it was only wind?
it's been a long time coming
i wore long sleeves
i'm coming down, i'm coming down, i'm coming down
hit me 310, and i'll be home at some point
i would drive all night to get to you, but my curfew is early and moms up at home
i would run for miles to get to you
but you gotta understand i can't 'cause M-I-N-O-R
i'm minorly stuck and it's not your fault
started as a simple lie, thinking love had chose us
we would talk into the night, and nobody would notice
then we become a brush fire, burning all the pain
how can we survive a desert without rain?
boy you know what to say, before i turn away
your words hit me like a hard rain in l.a.
scared to turn and look behind, think i'd see you hurting, and even when i close my eyes, i feel like the burden
excuse my french, but every time you turn your phone around, i just kind of lose my, lose my shit
'cause if i'm gonna learn how to love you, i need to unlearn how to love too
need to unlearn how to run when it feels right
excuse my mouth, but every time you run a little late, hanging with your friends, i, freak the fuck out
but it's not your fault, no, it's not your fault
oh my god, i'm tryin'
opened two double doors, typical, pretty sure i could grow up
probably chemical, i took up walking to turn it all off
did i fall out of line when i called you?
when I told you i'm fine, you were lied to
how could i think that all that i gave you was enough?
'cause every time i get too close, i just go mess it up
did i fall out of line when i called you?
pull myself together, you could watch it happen
we can make it better, breaking every habit
i keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
oh, we almost got away, we cut it close
the city's getting loud
if i choke, it's only 'cause i'm scared to be alone
been tryin' to work it out, you should know
i would do whatever you wanted
we don't have to leave the apartment
met you at the right time, this is what it feels like
livin' in a movie i've watched and funny, 'cause you couldn't have called it
oh, the train was cold, we left connecticut
our clothes matched enough to throw me off a bit, your phone was playing towers
and i need you sometimes, we'll be alright
hey, i feel like i might say the wrong thing
i hung up when i started calling, you probably would've laughed then, if you had seen it happen
hey, who took my place in bed when i left?
who laughs at everything that you've said?
i'm sure that i would like her, if i were slightly nicer
bet you wish you, never even met me
i don't blame you, broke your every heartbeat
hey, i parked across the street from your house, the lights were on, the music got loud
i doubt you would've seen me, i hid from everybody
hey, i feel like if we gave it one night, you'd hate me less and make it alright
just wish that we could fight now, i'd hold you on the comedown
i see you every night in my sleep, anticipatin' every bad dream
like fallin' with a knife you cut deep, you cut deep, you cut deep
i think that maybe i was right, back when i knew to draw the line
already gave what i could offer, maybe we'll work another time
i guess the thought of it's enough, no going back or switching up
i really wish that i could do that, walking away from you is tough
i know we've run it dry
i've heard that happens sometimes
i shouldn't be surprised, should i?
i've packed my bags in the middle of the night
a thousand times, i got up to say goodbye
i could be wrong, but i think that i'm for real this time
i've taken down all the pictures in my room
i've hidden things that reminded me of you
i know i've lied, but i think that i'm for real this time
i know that i've lied, but we're running dry
no, i won't come back this time, i know that I've lied
couldn't you tell when i was off?
you never asked me what it was
i kinda hoped you feel the same way, so that i'm not the only one
i never said it, but I know that i can't picture anything past 25
not like i care to know the time and not like i'm looking for that silence
self diagnosing 'til i'm borderline
i'll do whatever helps to sleep at night
until i'm feeling like an island
until i'm strong enough to hide it
what was i thinking looking for a sign?
as if i've ever seen the stars align
somebody take over the drive and somebody notice how i'm trying
when i'm toeing that line all of the time
calling it fine, calling it fine
how do you call it when you're in your head?
like when you really keep inside of it?
i only talk into the mirror, i'm only scared of getting bigger
at least i'll never turn to cigarettes
my brother shielded me from all of that
he said that smoking was a killer
he said he knows that i've been bitter
most of the game is unfamiliar
most of the girls are getting thinner
all of me, a wound to close
but I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know i was never good at coping
and if that's all it was if you're good giving in giving up
i dont know how you looked past my stupid fucking setbacks
is it just wishful thinking you'd grow up
And if you hear me leaving in the morning could you please pretend that it was only wind
i wish that i could block me out
